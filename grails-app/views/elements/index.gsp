<h2>New Elements in HTML5</h2>

<p>The internet has changed a lot since HTML 4.01 became a standard in 1999.</p>

<p>Today, some elements in HTML 4.01 are obsolete, never used, or not used the way they were intended to. These elements are removed or re-written in HTML5.</p>

<p>To better handle today's internet use, HTML5 includes new elements for better structure, better form handling, drawing, and for media content.</p>
