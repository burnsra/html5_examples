<h2>Video on the Web</h2>

<p>Until now, there has not been a standard for showing a video/movie on a web page.</p>

<p>Today, most videos are shown through a plug-in (like flash). However, different browsers may have different plug-ins.</p>

<p>HTML5 defines a new element which specifies a standard way to embed a video/movie on a web page: the &lt;video&gt; element.</p>
